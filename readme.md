# My Own Diary 1.0

## A personal calendar

* * * * *

**Diary** is a simple calendar for personal use, nothing fancy, 
just a way to save a list of activities, tasks or whatever stuff 
you have done on a daily basis. It can be used as a calendar for 
appointments, to-do or to-done list to keep track of your daily 
achievements.

Personally I use it to keep track of what I have done today in my 
computer, bugs fixed, programs coded or to sketch ideas.



### User interface

The whole app is just one html page, with one stylesheet and one script. 
It also uses a basic python controller and a python api to manage data.
You can use any database you want, mysql, mongo or even appengine datastore.



### Installation

Just copy the files to any web server and adapt accordingly to your data server.

    diary.html  -- the interface
    diary.css   -- the stylesheet
    diary.js    -- the script

    application -- the main entry point
    models.py   -- your data manager

**That's it. Enjoy it!**



### Warning!!1!

Because **Diary** uses the latest tricks in the web world, it only works in modern browsers like **Chrome** and **Safari**. Sorry guys, if you can make it work in Firefox and Explorer good for you and let me know.
